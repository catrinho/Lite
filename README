This is a pretty barebones MySQL browser, only really useful if you know SQL well enough to create/alter tables etc.
The idea is that at some point it'll make more things easier.
Currently on the ad-hoc todo list:
 -> set TITLE to SQL query
 -> interpret single-word queries as table name and switch to it's (browse?) view
 - maybe rewrite to use HTLM class? objects? search and stuff should be easier >.<
 - less hackery, more elegance, even if it costs 20 miliseconds more. Maybe init some classes (db, table, whatever) that can later be (re-)set, and use their methods instead of random static-var functions.
 - simple view for non-key tables. 
 - sqlite table to log queries
 - settings in regular file
 - results table in overflow: scroll; div, keep query input textarea visible.
 - SQL syntax coloring? google code and that other dude, maybe github, bookmarks
